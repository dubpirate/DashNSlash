# DashNSlash

After the BluGame competition, I wanted to make some games I could *actually* export, so I built this!
This is a side-scrolling game where you kill... I wanna say demons?

If you have a Mac and a wish to play my game, please email me! w@torkington.com

The purpose of this game was to familiarise myself with Monogame, C#, .NET, and Visual Studio. I believe I did just that.

# Highlights

If you care to look, there are some programming techniques that I've put in the game as a demonstration of my capabilities.
 Number: Recursive structure that drew the Score.
 EnemySpawner: I used Lambdas to remove enemies from the main list.
 Sprite (and children): Polymorphism (yay!).

# For Next Time

It is definitely not perfect, but I did learn a lot. Here are some thing's I learnt and that I'd like to do next time.
 
 - Comments: Where? How many? Brain still in 'Write first, ask questions later' mode doesn't help. Need more practice.
 
 - Get/Set: Still not comfortable with C#'s get and set auto properties.
 
 - Abstract vs Interface vs Virtual: I haven't done enough reading on these yet, so for next time I'll need to do that.
 
 - List vs ArrayList: They're different to Java, and I'm still getting used to them.
 
 - XPlatform: I only made it a Mac App because I'm still figuring out how to archive for different platforms with MonoGame.
 
 - Sprite Controllers: Next time I'm going to make an interface / abstract class for the spawners to regulate their behaviour.
 
 - Style Questions: Do the Getters / Setters go *before* or *after* the rest of the code? Is it ok that don't use underscores before private fields?
